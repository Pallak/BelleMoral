####APS320 - Representing Science on Stage

####Assignment description: 

>Theatres work in a number of different ways to bring audiences into the world of the plays presented.  Lobby displays may help to create a particular atmosphere from the moment a theatre-goer comes in the door.  Music, lighting and information about the play, performers and subject all attempt to help the audience shed the trappings of everyday life and enter the unique performance space.

>A theatre program serves a similar purpose.  Yes, programs often include general information about the theatre’s season and patrons (as well as some advertising).  However, there is always something specific about the play on stage.  Sometimes, those specifics are limited to the names/biographies of people involved, the running time of the show and acknowledgements of individuals and organizations that have helped make the performance possible.  Frequently, there is something more:  notes on some aspect of the play that the director or playwright feels the audience should know.
 
>Program notes can take many forms.  They may be short (one paragraph) or long (several pages).  They may include graphics.  They may deal with information about the playwright and/or the development of the play and its performance history.  They may deal with factual details—either about the play/playwright or the subject matter of the play.  Whatever form the program notes take, the goal is always to make the experience of seeing the play a richer one.

>Your assignment is to create a single program to go with your Final Short Scene Presentations.  

The assignment allowed the use of any medium for the program notes. I chose to create a quick single controller iOS app. The app displays the cluttered desk of the protagnist, Pearl MacIsaac. 

- The pictures of the cast lead to a view introducing the cast.
- The picture of the author leads an introduction to the author.
- The paper parchment alternating between the text "Pearl MacIsaac" and "Percival MacIsaac" represents Pearl's struggle to be recognized as a scientist of equal caliber by her male peers. Pressing it leads to a view which discusses the case of women in science in the 19th century.
- The moving shells add some motion to the desk and asks to be pressed. Pressing them animates a dog paw along them, signifying the mystery of the "dog ear" in the story.
- The encyclopedia contains a list of text and image references used to put together the app data.
